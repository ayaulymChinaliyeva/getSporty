		FRENCH OPEN MEMORIES, #9: ANDRE AGASSI D. ANDREI MEDVEDEV, 1999 FINAL

	<p style="text-align: center;">Agassi and Medvedev had spent the spring of 1999 trading conspiratorial smiles whenever their paths crossed. Andrei the Russian was playing some of the best tennis of his career, and Andre the American could take more than a little credit for it.

That April in Monte Carlo, Agassi had come across Medvedev drinking himself into a stupor after a defeat. The 24-year-old Medvedev told Agassi he was through, he was old, he couldn’t play “this f---ing game anymore.”

Agassi sat down and said, “How dare you? Here I am, 29, injured, divorced, and you’re [complaining] about being washed up at 24? Your future is bright.”
