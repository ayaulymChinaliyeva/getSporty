	<p style="text-align: center;">West Ham have confirmed the appointment of Manuel Pellegrini as their new manager on a three-year deal.

The 64-year-old Chilean, who has previously enjoyed spells in charge of Real Madrid and Manchester City, left his role with Hebei China Fortune over the weekend to join the Hammers.

Pellegrini will become the highest-paid manager in the club's history. It is understood he will receive around £7m a year, although he will be taking a significant pay cut having earned around £16m a year in China.
